# Quality-Movie-Data-Ingestion

## Problem Statement:

Movies related data needs to be ingested in a efficient and widely used Data Warehousing solution like Amazon Redshift. However the dataset available is low quality with missing data and having entries irrelevant to businesses use case. A system needs to be designed which runs quality checks on data and ingests it into a data warehouse. Additionally bad data needs to be stored and analysed, so that results about faulty data can be communicated to the upstream team.
